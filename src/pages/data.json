It is going to be a blog where users can register, login and logout; make, edit and delete posts. All of the users who are logged in can see the posts that are made, but only the user who made the post can edit/delete it. Users can also visit other users profile to see what only that particular person has been posting. \n My takeaways from this project include: managing models, views and templates; an introduction to user registration, login and logout functionality; and using forms.",

It implements Spotify API and uses asynchronous coding. This project taught me a great deal about HTTP requests and async coding in general.",
